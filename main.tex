\begin{abstract}
    A Kochen-Specker system is a set of points on the sphere,
    such that there is no~$\{0,1\}$-coloring such that
    at most one of two orthogonal points is assigned~$1$
    and of three pairwise orthogonal points exactly one
    is assigned~$1$.
    The existence of such a system is the basis of the Kochen-Specker
    and Free Will theorems.  At the time of writing, the smallest known
    KS system has 31 vectors.  

    Arends, Ouaknine and Wampler have shown that a KS system has at least
    18 vectors, by reducing the problem to the existence of graphs
    with a certain topological embeddability and non-colorability property.
    Deciding embeddability and the sheer number of graphs on more than~$17$
    vertices, proved the bottleneck in their search.

    Continuing their effort, we restrict our enumeration to smaller class of
    graphs and develop a practical decision procedure for embeddability, to
    establish an improved lower bound of 22.
