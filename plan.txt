Introduction (no KS systems with 17 or less vertices)

Theoretical improvements on graph generation. (bi-connectedness,
minimal order three, tri-connectedness(?))

Graph generation (check older results + order 18 via subgraphs, in
order 19 a graph appears that has no known non-embeddable subgraph
-> calculation -> find subgraph. Order 20 via cross products and
more subrgraphs)

Embeddability (simple embeddable graphs )
